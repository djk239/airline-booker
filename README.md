# airline-booker
Simulates the user booking a ticket on a flight, allowing for seat selection and a handful of airports to be picked from. User's seats will be saved and updated as a taken seat.


Program will also keep log of user's TICKET(s) allowing for an easy lookup. Ticket will also be printed to user.

NOTICE seperate files for each airport, one being MAIN CABIN and the other being FIRST CLASS, can easily be integreated to be the same file and changed to flight number's rather than airport names.
